# Angular Days - AngularJS 1.5+ - Wie man mit TypeScript und Komponenten umgeht

This example project is to follow the workshop [AngularJS 1.5+ - Wie man mit TypeScript und Komponenten umgeht](http://angular-days.de/session/angularjs-1-5-wie-man-mit-typescript-und-komponenten-umgeht/) at the Angular Days 2016 in Berlin.

To setup the project, clone this repo or download the zip archive. Following change into this folder and call

```bash
$ npm install
```

After that, all dependencies will download. Take a coffee or a tea, it can take some minutes.

To verify the installation works, you can call

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

and open a web browser on [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080). You should see "app works" in the browser.

To run a build you can also call `$ npm run build` which will create a `dist` folder. You should exclude this folder from the search index in Webstorm.
